## reverseC for Mediation Analysis
These functions examines the performance of mediation analysis methods in the presence of reverse causality.

## Installation
Requirements:
* R v3.4 or higher
* You will need the proper compiling tools for your platform.
  * For Windows (Rtools installer): https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
  * For MacOSX (clang and gfortran): https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

```
install.packages("devtools") # devtools must be installed first

devtools::install_github("MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR") # this is a dependency not present in R CRAN, it should be installed before reverseC

# these will fail to install when already loaded, and install_github will sometimes 
# load these as part of its activity, and will then try to install them if they need 
# an update for one of the package dependencies
install.packages(c("Rcpp","RcppEigen", "curl"), quiet=T) 

devtools::install_github("SharonLutz/reverseC",quiet=T)
```
The install process will involve compiling source code. If you are on MacOSX, this may involve the clang compiler issuing warnings about unknown pragmas similar to the text below. Do not be alarmed if you see these. If there is actually an error, it will be present among the last several messages issued by the compiler.
```
warning: pragma diagnostic pop could not pop, no matching push [-Wunknown-pragmas]
```

## Example:
```
library(reverseC)
?reverseMAsim # For details on this function

reverseMAsim(n = 1000, pX = 0.2, gamma0 = 0, gammaX = 0.2, varM = 1, beta0 = 0, betaX = 0, 
betaM = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), varY = 1, nSim = 100, nSimImai = 100, SEED = 1, plot.pdf = T, 
plot.name = "reverseMAplotIndirect.pdf", alpha_level = 0.05)

 reverseMAsim(n = 1000, pX = 0.2, gamma0 = 0, gammaX = 0, varM = 1, beta0 = 0, betaX = 0.2, 
betaM = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), varY = 1, nSim = 100, nSimImai = 100, SEED = 1, plot.pdf = T, 
plot.name = "reverseMAplotDirect.pdf", alpha_level = 0.05)

 reverseMAsim(n = 1000, pX = 0.2, gamma0 = 0, gammaX = 0.2, varM = 1, beta0 = 0, betaX = 0.2, 
betaM = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), varY = 1, nSim = 100, nSimImai = 100, SEED = 1, plot.pdf = T, 
plot.name = "reverseMAplotBoth.pdf", alpha_level = 0.05)
```

## Speeding things up with optional parameters:
### MultiProcessing And/Or Use of Threading and Eigen via C++
the reverseMAsim command accepts the following parameters:
* use_multi_processing, a boolean (T, F, True, or False), which turns on the multi-processing feature
* use_cpp, a boolean(T, F, True, or False), which activates the use of Rcpp RcppEigen, and threading if multiprocessing is not turned on as well.
* num_jobs, an integer specifying the number of processes or threads you wish to use.
```
#Example Using Rcpp with Eigen and 5 threads:

reverseMAsim(n = 1000, pX = 0.2, gamma0 = 0, gammaX = 0.2, varM = 1, beta0 = 0, betaX = 0.2, 
betaM = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), varY = 1, nSim = 100, nSimImai = 100, SEED = 1, plot.pdf = T, 
plot.name = "reverseMAplot.pdf", alpha_level = 0.05, use_cpp=T, num_jobs=5)


#Example Using MultiProcessing and vanilla R (without using Rcpp with Eigen) with 7 subprocesses:

reverseMAsim(n = 1000, pX = 0.2, gamma0 = 0, gammaX = 0.2, varM = 1, beta0 = 0, betaX = 0.2, 
betaM = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), varY = 1, nSim = 100, nSimImai = 100, SEED = 1, plot.pdf = T, 
plot.name = "reverseMAplot.pdf", alpha_level = 0.05, use_multi_processing=T, num_jobs=7)


#Example Using MultiProcessing and Rcpp with Eigen with 4 subprocesses (1 thread each):

reverseMAsim(n = 1000, pX = 0.2, gamma0 = 0, gammaX = 0.2, varM = 1, beta0 = 0, betaX = 0.2, 
betaM = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), varY = 1, nSim = 100, nSimImai = 100, SEED = 1, plot.pdf = T, 
plot.name = "reverseMAplot.pdf", alpha_level = 0.05, use_cpp=T, use_multi_processing=T, num_jobs=4)
```

### Important Considerations for the Faster Processing Strategies:

It is advisable that you tailor your num_jobs variable to be the # of your CPU cores - 1, at the maximum, to leave 1 core free to handle the original calling R process and any background OS processes. If you use too many procesess or threads, your system will become slow and relatively unresponsive and may lock up until the processing completes.

The Multiprocessing strategies will use significantly more RAM, as they will store approximately the same amount of data per process that the vanilla approaches and Rcpp with Eigen and threading approach will store. If you swamp out your system RAM, paging will slow your system to a crawl, and may require a system restart to regain control.

If you force-stop an R terminal or R process that has already begun a multi-processing task, it may not be able to close all the child processes before it terminates. They will have to be stopped/killed before they will stop consuming CPU cycles and Memory and release the system resources.

## Warning: Do not try to access package internals directly or do so at your own risk!
If you try to run methods/functions that are not exported and intended for end users, and feed these functions environments, parameters, or values that are not correctly formed, it could result in an uncaught or uncatchable C++ exception or segmentation fault. If this occurs, it will kill your R session/terminal and if you were working within RStudio it will probably crash too.
